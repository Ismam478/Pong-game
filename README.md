Pong Game

A modern implementation of the classic Pong game built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript, featuring AI opponents, multiple difficulty levels, sound effects, and mobile support.

Overview

This project recreates the classic Pong experience with a modern visual style and smooth gameplay.
It was developed using an AI-assisted (vibe coding) workflow to speed up iteration, while the final structure, logic, and behavior were reviewed and refined manually.
